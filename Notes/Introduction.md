Getting Familiar with python
## Input
The input for the program usually consists of numbers and strings that are separated with spaces and newlines. 

For example for the following input:
```123 456 9254```
```
l= list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
# we can use indexing to get the elements seperately
```
